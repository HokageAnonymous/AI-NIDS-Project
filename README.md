# AI-Powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

This project implements an **AI-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** using
Machine Learning techniques to detect malicious network traffic.
It is developed as part of a **Cybersecurity Internship – Major Project**.

The system analyzes simulated network traffic and classifies it as **Benign** or **Malicious**
using a Random Forest classifier and provides real-time results through an interactive dashboard.
